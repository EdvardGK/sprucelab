feat: Add IFC validation service and model view enhancements

Implemented comprehensive IFC quality validation system to address real-world
BIM coordinator needs. Added transparent quality reporting that detects schema
errors, GUID duplication, geometry completeness, and LOD issues - addressing
limitations of tools like Solibri and SimpleBIM that hide quality problems.

Backend Changes:
- Added IFC validation service (services_validation.py) with 6 validation checks
- Created IFCValidationReport database model with migration
- Integrated validation into upload flow (runs before extraction)
- Added /api/models/{id}/validation/ endpoint
- Added file_size tracking to Model (BigIntegerField)
- Fixed DRF pagination response handling

Frontend Changes:
- Fixed pagination handling for DRF paginated responses
- Added table/gallery view toggle for models
- Implemented latest-version filtering (shows only newest version)
- Added file size formatting (KB/MB/GB)
- Updated TypeScript types to match backend schema
- Enhanced ProjectDetail page with dual view modes

Validation Checks:
- Schema validation (ifcopenshell.validate)
- GUID duplication detection
- Geometry completeness checking
- Property set analysis
- LOD analysis

Files: 25+ files modified/created
Database: 1 new table (ifc_validation_reports)
Testing: Validated with 447-element IFC model
